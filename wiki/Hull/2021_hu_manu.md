## 3/5/21

### What we did
- Took plug and materials to SunRez
- Detached plug from current tabletop to repair extensive damage, and also it was not level.
- Bought new plywood to replace table top. 
- Discarded female mold, due to air leaks and poor surface quality.

### For next time:
- Make new tabletop.
- Create new mold the correct way (Mark from SunRez will show us!)
- Attach plug to tabletop
- Seal tabletop and repair plug surface

### Notes:
Wear PROPER PPE:
- N95 mask
- Designate long sleeves and pants for workdays (to protect from fiberglass)
- Safety Glasses
- Pull back hair

Regarding Manufacturing:
- Must be on a level surface
- Mold must be airtight

Methods for Removing Fiberglass:
- Thoroughly use air hose at the end of workday to remove fiberglass from clothes and shoes. (Avoid touching your face too much)
- Wrap duct-tape around fingers and dap onto any exposed skin
- Use a vacuum - with the nozzle removed.
- d o g

## 3/12/21

What we did
- table not level
- clamped it to long, straight metal beams
- use a level to make sure its not warped (make sure the 2 short sides are level)
- use sawhorses that r the same height (extra sawhorse in the middle for support)
- wood shims and bondo to fill in gaps
- golf ball size grey stuff and 1+1/4 inch harderner mix (just read the bondo instructions)
- wear gloves for bondo, well venilated area if possible
- clean bondo putty knives asap after each use with acetone
- screwed tabletop (mark the 2x4 with sharpie to use as a guide!
- cut holes in the bottom panel for access - in order to drill the plug to the table later
- note: use a big drill bit to cut a hole for the jigsaw to fit into, then use a jigsaw to actually cut out the entire shape
- make sure there is a centerline on the plug, and draw a straight line on the table to line them up
- Line beam up along the plug side, use another straight edge at a 90 deg angle, make sure distance from beam to point of contact is equal at nose and tail, which is 12” for us

Random tips
- panchos is a good place for lunch!
- they like it when u keep the back door closed at sunrez 
- bring tangerines as a snack!

More fiberglass tips
- Use back of sponge for fiberglass on hands and  s c r u b
- or use reallllly hot water, then reallly cold water (pores will close up and eject the fiberglass?? appearantly)

## 3/19/21

What we did
- Covered screw heads with bondo, on the table, and sanded the areas flat
- Centered the plug on the tabletop and drew an outline, for easy placement later
- Sealed the tabletop by painting it with a thick layer of light cure resin
- Used handheld UV lamps to cure the tabletop seal
- Used palm sanders to widen and open up damaged areas on the plug, to prepare them for patching

Tips
- When painting on resin, go over any given area three times in a criss-cross pattern. Make sure to hold the brush very lightly on the final pass. This reduces brush marks (also called "roping."

## 3/23/21

What we did
- Flipped the plug upsidedown and sanded the bottom extensively with a large sander. The goal was to make the bottom of the plug flat.
- The bottom of the plug was checked for flatness by holding a straight edge up against it and seeing if the straight edge sat flat on the surface.
- Used thin box cutter knives to cut away delaminated fiberglass from damaged areas on the plug surface
- Used an epoxy resin (Pro-Set) thickened with Cabosil and Q-Cell (fumed silica and microballoons) to repair damaged areas. Resin had a mayonnaise consistency.
- Paper was crumpled up and shoved into any gaping holes, to create a base surface for the repair.
- UV cure resin was painted over the filled damaged areas, to seal them.

Tips:
- Make sure to check a smaller batch of resin first to make sure it cures properly.

## 3/24/21

What we did
- Used 60 grit sandpaper on long sanding blocks (called "blocking") to sand smooth the areas where resin was painted on.
- Accidentally sanded through the entire resin layer, also got carried away and sanded through most of the original Duratec layer.
- Because bondo is a terrible mold surface (it does not separate during de-molding), the entire plug needed to be painted with a layer of resin.
- UV cure resin was painted on thick, in a criss-cross pattern to prevent roping.
- Cured outside in the sunlight

Tips
- Sand very lightly (let the sandpaper do the work). As soon as one area is smooth, move on. 
- Sand at 45 degree angles only (w.r.t. ground), to ensure surface fairness.

## 3/26/21

What we did
- Very carefully sanded the entire sealed plug surface with sanding blocks (120 grit), until smooth.
- Accidentally sanded too far in a few areas, needed to re-seal those areas with more resin
- Painted on more UV cure resin in specified areas, began sanding down those areas

Tips:
- Draw a circle on areas that need to be filled up, and draw an X on areas that need to be sanded down
- Use a pencil to draw circles and X's. Pen ink can interact poorly with the resin, whereas graphite does not.

## 4/2/21

What we did
- Faired the nose of the submarine (because it was oversanded)

Fairing Instructions:
- remove dust from plug with a bit of acetone and a rag (not a shop rag bc it desintegrates and sticks to the plug)
- apply resin (dont use UV cure resin when working outside, but if you are inside it means you have infinite work time!)
- fair carefully with a scraper (keep curve consistent)
- cure!!! (see what happens when you don't let it cure properly)
- sand at +- 45 degrees from the grain of the sub and maximize surface area to avoid holes
- wash tools with acetone after

Differences between resins!
- Q Cell : finer, mixes well, sands well, glass microballoons more brittle
- Cabosil : good for thickening (can mix with Q Cell)
- Duratec : black, sands smooth as a baby's bottom 

Random Tips
- hold the sharpie like a paintbrush
- for fairing, cover in spray paint, lightly sand, reveals low spots
- MAKE SURE RESIN IS CURED BEFORE SANDING, otherwise it gets gummy and messes up the sandpaper

For next time;
- fill crack near tail and hole near nose

Xander or somebody plz fill this out

## 4/5/21

Members: Antoinette Gautier, Kylan Dennis, Sharron Perez

What we did:
- Sanded down hull plug for smoothness (not fairness).
- Quick acetone "wash" for the hull plug and tabletop for smoothness and to get rid of dust. Light sanding for tabletop.
- Concluded that perfect fairness for plug was not possible, proceeded to plan holes for plug fastening to tabletop.
- Holes pre-drilled and screws added part-way into tabletop. Holes (6) had to be cut out of certain points under the table support to access drilling points. 

For next time:
- Another layer of resin for tabletop. Fasten hull plug to tabletop and start next resining step for plug to table connection edge. 

## 4/16/21

-scraping excess bondo off of table with razors so that we can make a more accurate 90 degree angle with the plug

-note on precision bondo work: use teeny tiny batches

shopping list: 
- high build polyurethene primer spray can
- flashlight
 
## 4/17/21

Members: Signe, Kylan, Victor

- Squared up edges with right angle square. Dragged square across Bondo while still workable and sanded with 150 grit to achieve 90 degrees.
- 	Make sure to look at eye level and use a flashlight to check for gaps.
- Purchased 4 cans of 2-1 fillable and sandable primer and a polyurethane glossy top sealant coat. Read instructions before use. 

## 4/23/21

Members: Antoinette, Victor, Paul

- Sprayed glossy polyurethane outside. Set up Eazyup with grey tarp against wall with dumpster to block wind.
- 	Remember to bring somethings to do (homework, laptop, cards, games, etc.) since it takes 2 hours to dry between coats. 
- Spray a thick coat but not so thick that it runs. Sand with 220 girt before final coat.


## 4/26/21

Members: Signe and Sharron
What we did:
- Went over the radius again with Bondo
	- Scraped away any excess cured bondo we could and sanded down prominent ridges and bumps
    - Filled in any gaps with bondo (use fingers to push the bondo into the negatives, then firm but light pass with radius piece)
    - Bondo done in moderately hot and small batches
- Note: do NOT do workday in the rain with the canopy...the canopy is temporary...the rain is eternal

## 4/30/21

Members: Antoinette, Victor, Paul
- Redid the bondo'd radius by applying small batches of bondo with a finger and then running smooth with a radius.
- Sanded bondo with 220 grit sandpaper in between passes as well as cleaned with a small amount of acetone.
- Remember to use a razor to scrape off the squeezeout on top.
- Applied 2 liberal coats of priper to fill any small holes or gaps in the bondo.
- Applied 2 coats of polyurethane to redone area.
- Played many rounds of the card game "James Bond" to pass the time in between coats and escape the 93 degree weather.

## 5/1/21

Members: Signe, Kylan, Asa, Victor
- Looked for uncovered bondo spots and sprayed with quick-drying primer and polyurethane coating.Wait 10-15 minutes between coats for primer, about the same time for the polyurethane (ckeck instructions)
- Wiped down plug with dry shop towel and then a slightly damp shop towel to remove dust before moving on.
- DO NOT USE TOO MUCH TEFLON COATING! ONE BOTTLE COST ~$75! Use about 1/3 of a bottle (one bottle was 1 quart?)
	- Use a shop rag to wipe a THIN layer of teflon over the plug AND table
	- Shake off any loose fibers when using the shop rag
	- Have people switch sides to ensure even coat
	- Wait ~30 minutes between coats (bring something to do, i.e. cards)
	- Coat a total of 3 times.

## 5/3/21

Members: Antoinette, Sharron, Alex
What we did:
- Waxing the plug
	- Product: TR Mold Release Wax (High-Temp) (White lid)
    - Application: 
    	- Initial layer applied in small circles, even coating, using the sponge in the tin.
        - Start on one side of the plug and start at one end. We started on the right at the front/nose of the plug, slowly making our way down to the tail tip.
        - After doing one side of the plug, move on to the next. Then do the same method for the table.
    - Buffing:
    	- Start buffing on one side 12 minutes after you started waxing. You can go a little slower than the person waxing, and we had two people buffing at a time, one person behind the other, just to ensure we got it as smooth as possible.
    	- Microfiber cloths. Took them back to campus after workday to wash off the wax.
    - Layering
    	- Wait about 45 to 60 minutes between initial applications (also given in the instructions on the can) when layering the wax. 
        - We did 4 layers of wax overall.      
- Ordered Black Tooling Gel Coat from RevChem
	- We ran the numbers and estimated that 1 gallon would be enough to cover an estimated 60 sq-ft area with an 18-20 mil thick coat for the plug and table.
    - I (Sharron) called RevChem directly and got redirected to Mark Prince. I sent an email with our request, and some details about our project and past projects, and had a follow up call (05/04) about receiving the product.
    - Should expect to receive the shipment at SunRez Wednesday morning (05/05 around 7 am).
    - Details about payment or receiving for free and distributing a sponsorship packet will be discussed later.
