# HSI Log 2021 - 2022

## Resources:

## 10/30/21
- Had lunch in PC yum yum
- Need a budget.
   - I think we have about $500 from electronic steering and might use some of Drivetrain's budget 
- Steering
    - Rough design of mechanical steering system
    - Looked into y-splitter for morse cables
- HSI
    - Measured how large the main hatch is on Santiana and transferred it to Calypso (37 inches)
    - Measured Ky for hatch size 
    - Made access hatch and deadman buoy cutout
    - Finalized that hatch and viewport is separate 
    - Found release mechanism for main hatch
    - Modified side plates
    - More space for steering mechanism 
    - Explained and drew mechanical steering and and deadman buoy 

## 11/6/21
- Hatch
     - Marked out hatch placement on top half of hull
     - Cutting out hatch next week
- Foam
     - Calculated necessary buoyancy for hatch and how much foam is needed (see picture of whiteboard)
- Deadman buoy
     - Planned out design of deadman buoy
     - Still need to work on winding mechanism
- Plans for next week
     - CAD deadman buoy
     - CAD steering system
     - Access hatch placement (and how many hatches)
     - How to attach and open hatches
     - Hull end cut-off hatch
     - Stabilizing/dorsal fin
     - Lecture on better sleep/eating habits?
     - Practice Chinese and translate all drawings into Chinese for manufacturing

## 11/13/21
- Hatch
     - Cut out hatch
     - Hull added foam to hatch (insert picture of calculations)
     - Sanded edges 
     - Access hatch will remain at the bottom of the hull
- Steering
     - Finalized that we won’t/can’t split the morse cable 
     - Going with similar steering system to Santiana
     - Started the CAD for the linkage
- Things to do next week
     - CAD steering system
     - CAD deadman buoy
     - Figure out what to do with end of tail (turn it into a hatch or put in tailcone)
     - Latch mechanism for hatches 
     - Stabilizing fins?

## 11/20/21
- Steering 
   - Finished CADing half of the steering system (yaw fins)
     - Decided to use 1 inch aluminium extrusions to connect the fins together 
     - Extrusions connected by drop in fasteners and coner connecters 
     - The fins themselves are connected to the aluminium extrusions by drilling a 0.205” hole through the 0.5” rod to connect it to the hole in the center of the aluminium extrusion
     - Lengths of extrusions are not finalized
     - At one end, there is a horizontal bar that connects to the morse cable at different lengths from the center to provide a 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 mechanical advantage, with a max deflection of 18.4 degrees in each direction
     - The morses cable moves at most 1 inch 
- Deadman buoy
     - Ethan worked with Miles to CAD deadman buoy and the bucket holding it in the sub
- Attachment to the hull
     - We will put foam along the inside edges of the hull, fiberglass it in, drill holes through both layers (slightly larger than the screw diameter to make sure the screw can remain perpendicular to the hole)
     - We will place threaded inserts on the deadman bucket for the screws to screw into (attached with epoxy)
     - This allows us to remove the bucket whenever we need to service the drivetrain

## 1/8/22
- Steering
     - Control cables are push pull cables (bike cables)
     - Redesigned fin connection for mechanical advantage (modeled after motorcycle throttle system)
- Hatches 
     - Access hatch is now on the side for better access to both top and bottom steering fins
     - Flush mounted latches for access hatch
     - Tail hatch would likely use flush mounted latches
     - If we decide on a tailcone, we can use “set screws” to hold it onto the tail
- Future plans
     - Figure out manufacturing of fairings and steering fins (likely to be 3D printed and fiberglassed over), viewport/nose cone
     - Stoppers so linkage bars don’t hit the drivetrain
     - How do we make the fins return to neutral (torsion spring?)
     - Bearings for interaction between fairings and fins(thrust bearings)
     - Determine tail cone or hatch for the tail (leaning towards tailcone to reduce drag)
     - Stabilizing fins in the front of sub?
     - Come up with list of things to buy
     - Start electronic steering if we are virtual for a long time

## 1/22/22
- Steering
     - Discussed attachment of torsion spring
     - Rod connecting fin to aluminum extrusion will probably be aluminum
     - Rod will connect to aluminum extrusion through a  screw in the middle of the extrusion, rod will have countersunk hole so it sits flush with the rod
     - Torsion spring will sit on top of that
     - Disk with screw will attach to the bottom of rod to prevent movement of spring 
     - Alaina has connections to Envision studio, I (Victor) can reach out to Triton 3D about 3D printing the fins and fairings
     - Ethan will finish up deadman buoy and make sure our fins and fairings are 3D printable 
- Future plans
     - Calculate torque on the fins to see if torsion spring can withstand the torque
     - Find way to attach rod to fin (dowel pins?)
     - How much torque does it take to turn the fin x amount of degrees (20 degrees?) and is that achievable
     - How to attach thrust bearings to fin and fairing
     - Stabilizing fins?
     - Look into electronic steering

## 2/19/22
- Steering
     - Added keyed hub and keyed shaft to CAD model
     - Added cutouts in fins for keyed hub to sit as flush as possible in the fin
- Deadman buoy
     - Finalized retaining mechanism 
- Logistics
     - Made spreadsheet with list of purchases we need
     - Will add on to drivetrain’s list of Mcmastercarr purchases
- Future plans
     - Finish winding mechanism for the deadman buoy
     - Purchase parts
     - Contact digital media lab to 3D print fins and fairings
     - Finish broken CAD of steering system
