# Latest Submarine

Our latest submarine is Santiana, which we intended to race in ISR 2019.

Santiana’s hull was retrofitted from “Spicy Tuna Roll,” raced in ISR 14, which was made with a wet layup of fiberglass.
The nose-cone and windows were replaced, the steering was improved upon, and the propulsion system was changed from a
tuna tail to a new propeller.
