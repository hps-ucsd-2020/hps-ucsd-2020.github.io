## Grabcad Rules 2022### 
File Sorting
1. Place your work in the correct subteam folder. the only Solidworks file that should be in the main folder is the full assembly.

2. Within each subteam folder, create a folder for each assembly which will be inserted into the full team assembly, ie drivetrain assembly. The only solidworks file in this folder should be the teams full assembly.

3. keep continuing this train down until you get to parts, which will be contained in athe folder named after the assembly they live in.
Example:
2022-2023 Propeller Submarine
(f) Drivetrain
	(f) Sideplates & Gearbox
    	(f) Pedal System
        (f) Sideplates & Supports
        	(assem.) Sideplates and Supports
            (part) Left Plate
            (part) Right Plate
            (part) Support 1
            (part) Support 2
        (f) Gearbox System
        (assem.) Sideplates and Gearbox
    (f) Propeller System
    (f) Shaft System
    (assem.) Drivetrain Full Assemby
(f) Hull
(assem.) Full Assembly
### Naming Convention
first time making part:
name_of_partv1.SLDPRT

if completely remaking:
name_of_partv2.SLDPRT
- place in same folder as v1 (assumed latest version is correct)

if making 2 options (ie rectangle or crescent tail)
name_of_part_descriptorv1.SLDPRT
and
name_of_part_descriptorv1.SLDPRT
(diff descriptors).
