      The Drivetrain subteam designs and manufactures the propulsion mechanism of the submarine.
      They efficiently convert the pilot's pedaling motion to power a propellor or a non-propellor
      system (like a fish tail, for instance), developing both computer-aided design and machining skills.
      
      This year, they are creating a fish-like tail to propel the submarine. After discussing
      and reseaching methods for obtaining the desired motion, they model their design on Soliworks.
      They are working on a variable frequency tail by changing gear ratios, which has never been done before!
      After modeling our parts, we create the toolpaths and manufacturing documents with the necessary
      dimensions and tolerancing to bring the parts to life!
      
      Once trained, machinists will develop a process that produces a part with the required specifications.
      Operating CNC machines with in house generated tool paths, working on manual mills and lathes,
      and 3D printing are just a few methods that machinist at HPS use to manufacture an award winning drivetrain.

      The Hull subteam designs, simulates and manufactures the outer shell of the submarine, balancing
      hydrodynamics, speed, and maneuverability. They make use of computer-aided modeling software as well
      as get their hands dirty when laying up, curing, and sanding the hull.
      
      After choosing airfoils and modeling a few different submarine hulls in Solidworks, this team then
      simulates it in a finite element anaylsis (FEA) software to determing the optimal, hydrodynamic shape.
      
      Then it's onto manfucaturing the plug, a mold, and finally the actual hull out of composites like fiberglass
      or carbon fiber! Check out <a class="link-warning" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi431FmxXRU"> this video</a>

    The Dive subteam coordinates all dive related activities such as pool tests, scuba certification for
    new members and elaborating safety protocols. The dive team focuses on the pool-related activities
    such as pool tests and training for the competition. Dive team's two most important jobs are pilot
    safety and ballasting the submarine - maintaining a neutral and flat buoyancy is vital for speed and
    maneuverability.

- name: HSI and Steering

      The HSI subteam is responsible for the pilot's interaction with the submarine through controls and
      steering mechanisms. The most important part of the HSI subteam is the dead man buoy.
      
      When the sub is in the water, it is flooded, meaning any issues with the pilot can be potentially
      dangerous. The dead man buoy works on a switch which must be constantly held, and if it is released
      this will notify the divers that something is wrong.

      The hatches on the submarine provide access to both the cabin and the various mechanical parts of the sub.
      These include the maintenance hatch for drivetrain access near the rear, the pilot access hatch, and the
      lower draining hatch.
      
      Additionally, there are release mechanisms for these hatches, namely an internal release mechanism on
      the top hatch for the diver to be able to open and close their exit.

      The Electronics subteam creates and programs experimental devices to enhance the submarine, developing projects
      like electronic steering and buoyancy control. They use C++ and Arduinos to control servos and other electronic
      components. The current projects they are working on include an electronic steering system, a CVT motor, a pilot
      information display, and a variable pitch propellor.

- name: Documentation and Media

      The Documentation/Media subteam chronicles and organizes the research and processes used by all other subteams for
      posterity, as well as communicates our journey by creating and managing our own website, wiki and social media.

      This team essentially manages communication within and without the team, managing the website you are reading right
      now! (hello!) They help create multimedia tutorials on our team wiki (accessible on the wiki tab), as well as review
      and edit engineering drawings and design reports, developing skills in programming, web design and technical communication skills.
