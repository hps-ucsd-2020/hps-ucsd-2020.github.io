			The Hull subteam designs, simulates and manufactures the outer shell of the submarine, balancing hydrodynamics, speed, and maneuverability. They make use of computer-aided modeling software as well as get their hands dirty when laying up, curing, and sanding the hull.

			After chosing airfoils and modeling a few different submarine hulls in Solidworks, this team then simulates it in a finite element anaylsis (FEA) software to determing the optimal, hydrodynamic shape. Then it's onto manfucaturing the plug, a mold, and finally the actual hull out of composites like fiberglass or carbon fiber!
